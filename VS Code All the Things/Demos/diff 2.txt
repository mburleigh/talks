When dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating; you even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought records. Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose -- and excluding that which is painful. Leave bigotry in your quarters; there's no room for it on the bridge. Improve a mechanical device and you may double productivity. But improve man, you gain a thousandfold. He tasks me. He tasks me; and I shall have him. I’ll chase him ’round the moons of Nibia and ’round the Antares maelstrom and ’round Perdition’s flames before I give him up.

You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, and irrational fear of the unknown. There is no such thing as the unknown. Only things temporarily hidden, temporarily not understood. Live Long and Prosper. Luke, I am your father.

In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see. Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. You remove those obstacles. Without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die. Beam Me Up, Scotty! For everything, there is a first time.
